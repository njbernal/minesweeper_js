# Minesweeper JS with AI
### A Basic minesweeper game with AI.

Working from my implementiation of the Harvard CS50 AI course (Week 1: Minesweeper) assignment, but in Javascript (instead of Python) so I can use it on a webpage.

This is a work in progress, and I am learning as I do it.

The game is plyable here: [njbernal.github.io/minesweeper_js](https://njbernal.github.io/minesweeper_js/)
